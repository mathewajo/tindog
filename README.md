A tinder for dogs - This is my dream project! I am working on this to make this a reality!

Goals:
  - Dogs can view other potentional dogs to mate in a tab/mobile in a 5km radius. 
  - Using artifical intelligence algorithams, we will analize emotions of the dog from their facial eye movements and sounds. In short we will see if your dogs likes the photo of the mate.
  - Using artifical intelligence I need to analize dogs emotions, what kind of like is this? just like a sister or something romantic?
  - If the algorithm says no, automatially next photo appears!
- If yes, this dogs will send a friend request to the other dog.
- Other dog can also do the same process and if my algorithm detects a positive vibe, we will send a notification to both owners.  
- One of the owner should pay a fee of 4.99 euros to get the details of the dog. If the owner makes a payment, he will get the details of the dog plus he will be getting a coin that he can use for the next time. Once payment is made, details of the dog will be sent to the owner who made the payment. 


- We can also create a VR set up for dogs and cats and track their emotions!

What about this idea? Do you wanna join with me? Let's do it!
